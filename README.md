# mews-clustering

## Project Description
Dedicated to determining success of clustering algorithms with the given input by the mews project

## Project Structure
- `data/`: holds txt files to be used as input
- `MewsGraph.py`: contains abstract class `MewsGraph` to help with loading and outputting graphs in the our desired format
- `determine-weights.py`: file to determine range of weights per method
- `grab-most-related.py`: reduces input graph based on weight thresholds and outputs reduced graph
